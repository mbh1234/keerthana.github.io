**Abstract:** 

Non-verbal reasoning involves solving visual and spatial problems without verbal input, often using
associative and pattern-recognition cues. This paper applies Hopfield Networks to two non-verbal
reasoning tasks: identifying the Odd-One-Out and predicting the next sequence member. The network
achieved 100% accuracy in both tasks under standard conditions. To test robustness, noise was added
to images by flipping pixels, with results showing reliable performance up to 4000 pixel flips (40%
noise). Beyond this threshold, accuracy declined sharply. These findings illustrate Hopfield Networksâ€™
potential in handling complex, noisy data in non-verbal reasoning tasks, offering a promising approach
for cognitive and pattern-recognition applications where data may be incomplete or distorted.
