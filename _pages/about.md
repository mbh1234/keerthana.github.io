## About me:
Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Keerthana, a final year undergraduate at IIT Kanpur. I'm majoring in Electrical Engineering with minors in Machine learning, Computer systems, Management sciences and Philosophy. My institute ranks #1 in research & innovation in India and holds a QS rank of 96 globally in Electrical and Computer Engineering.

I'm grateful for opportunities at such a research-oriented institute, where I got the chance to explore various fields including machine learning, deep learning, AI, web-development, UI/UX designs, competetive coding, crypography and core electrical domains. With three publications in progress, I am confident that my research interests lie in using ML and AI to solve real-world problems, particularly in the field of Electrical Engineering. I hope to make a contribution to solve real-world problems with ML, AI and Statistics.  

**Hobbies :** 
In my free time, I enjoy a variety of activities, including playing badminton, reading books, meditating, and repeatedly cleaning my room to keep it organized.

**Fun Facts :** 
- Exploring local cultures and traditions excites me â€” it deepens my understanding of the world.
- I love learning new languages and am currently studying Spanish and French. I'm fascinated by the idea of traveling to different countries and speaking in their native languages.
