**Hey there!** ðŸ‘‹

I'm Keerthana, a final year undergraduate at IIT Kanpur. I'm majoring in Electrical Engineering with minors in Machine learning, Computer systems, Management sciences and Philosophy. My institute ranks #1 in research & innovation in India and holds a QS rank of 96 globally in Electrical and Computer Engineering.

I'm grateful for opportunities at such a research-oriented institute, where I got the chance to explore various fields including machine learning, deep learning, data science, AI, web-development, UI/UX design, competetive coding, embedded systems, cryptography and core electrical domains. With three publications in progress, I am confident that my research interests lie in using ML, AI and Statistics to solve real-world problems, particularly at the intersection of technology and engineering. I aim to make meaningful contributions by applying data-driven approaches to solve real-world challenges across diverse domains. 

**Hobbies :** 
In my free time, I enjoy a variety of activities, including playing chess & badminton, reading books, meditating and repeatedly cleaning my room to keep it organized.

**Fun Facts :** 
- Exploring local cultures and traditions excites me â€” it deepens my understanding of the world.
- I love learning new languages and am currently studying Spanish and French. I'm fascinated by the idea of traveling to different countries and speaking in their native languages.
