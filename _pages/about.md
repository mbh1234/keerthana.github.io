## About me

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Keerthana, a final year undergraduate at IIT Kanpur. I'm majoring in Electrical Engineering with a minor in Machine learning, Computer systems, Management sciences and Philosophy. My institute ranks #1 in research and innovation in India and holds a QS rank of 96 globally in Electrical and Computer Engineering.

I'm grateful that my experience at such research oriented institute, I've explored various fields including machine learning, deep learning, ai, web-development, competetive coding and core electrical domains. With three publications in progress, I am confident that my research interests lie in using ML and AI to solve real-world problems, particularly in the field of Electrical Engineering. I hope to make a contribution to solve real-world problems with ML.

**Hobbies :** 

In my free time, I enjoy a variety of activities, including playing badminton, reading books, meditating, and repeatedly cleaning my room to keep it organized.

**Fun Facts :**  

- Iâ€™m fascinated by exploring local cultures and traditions, as it deepens my understanding of the world.
- I love learning new languages and am currently studying Spanish and French. I'm fascinated by the idea of traveling to different countries and speaking in their native languages.
