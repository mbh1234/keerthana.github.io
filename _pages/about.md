Hey there! 

I'm Keerthana, a final year undergraduate at IIT Kanpur. I'm majoring in Electrical Engineering with a minor in Machine learning, Computer systems, Management sciences and Philosophy. My institute ranks one in the research and innovation in India and a QS rank of 96 globally in the fields of Electrical and Computer Engineering. 

With my experience at such research oriented institute, I've explored various fields including machine learning, deep learning, ai, web-development, competetive coding and core electrical domains. With the 3 publications that I'm writing, I feel confident enough to say that my research interests are in the fields of ML, AI to solve real world problems, especially in the domains of Electrical engineering. 

**Hobbies :** In my free time, I'd love to read books, sing and meditate. 
**Fun Fact :**  I have a knack for remembering almost every incident but forget my phone charger almost everywhere.
