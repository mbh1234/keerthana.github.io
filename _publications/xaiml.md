**Abstract**

With the rapid growth of e-commerce and online banking, credit card scam has become a significant challenge. Traditional approaches to detect scam have been outperformed by machine learning techniques. However, the understanding behind the classification of transactions as fraud or legitimate is limited. To address this issue, we have implemented two explainable AI (XAI) methods- Local Interpretable ModelAgnostic Explanations (LIME) and Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) across eight machine learning models which include logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, support vector machine, extreme gradient boost, Naive Bayes classifier, K-nearest neighbors and a basic neural network. The results show how individual features of the dataset contribute to the decision of a specific prediction.
